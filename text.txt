Two years ago in July of 2009 our Mother was diagnosed with Stage 3B Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC). 	 
IBC is not detectable on Mammograms, so usually by the time it is diagnosed, as with our Mother, it has 	 
already spread. When cancer has spread the doctors are not blessed with protocols that give you hope. 	 
In August of 2010 we found out it had spread to her liver and lungs and she was given less than a year 	 
to live. At that time she made the decision to go to Mexico for an experimental treatment that combined 	 
lower doses of chemo/radiation with a cancer vaccine. We have been blessed with great friends and fam-	 
ily that have helped us over the year to raise money for that treatment. Last year’s golf tournament was a 	 
huge success thanks to a lot of people it helped our family give our Mother 10 months under the treatment 	 
in Mexico, but unfortunately not being able to have immediate access to doctors while at home and the 	 
increasing expenses we were unable to continue that treatment. Our Mother has now chosen to see a 	 
naturopathic doctor here in the US that gives her high dose vitamin C two times a week. This treatment, 	 
like the experimental vaccine, is not covered under insurance. Our mom’s will is incredible and we want 	 
to be able to help her continue this type of treatment. Our family would like to express our deepest thanks 	 
and gratitude for all of your prayers and support through these trying times. We know it is in God's hands 	 
and we appreciate that He gave us this opportunity to help our mom.
